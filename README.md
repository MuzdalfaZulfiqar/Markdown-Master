# Markdown Master

Markdown is a React-based application designed for creating, managing, and formatting notes using Markdown. It offers a straightforward interface and essential features to facilitate efficient note-taking.

## Features

- **Sidebar Navigation**: The app includes a sidebar that displays all created notes. Notes are sorted with the most recent updates or additions at the top, making it easy to find and manage them.

- **Markdown Editor**: A Markdown editor is integrated for formatting notes with headings, lists, bold, italics, code blocks, and more. This allows for clear and organized note content.

- **Note Management**: Notes can be added, deleted, and updated with ease. The app provides simple and intuitive controls for managing notes.

- **Local Storage**: Notes are stored in the browser's local storage, ensuring data persistence and accessibility without external dependencies.

## Usage

- **Creating a Note**: Use the "Add Note" button to create a new note. The Markdown editor can then be used to input and format text.

- **Updating a Note**: Select a note from the sidebar to edit its content. Changes are saved automatically.

- **Deleting a Note**: Remove a note by clicking the delete icon next to it in the sidebar.
